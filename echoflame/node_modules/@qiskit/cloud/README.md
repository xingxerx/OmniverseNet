# Qiskit.js cloud

:atom_symbol: Quantum Information Science Kit library to use the [Quamtum Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net).

Please visit the [main repository](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-js) of the project to know about the rest of the tools.

## Install

:coffee: Install lastest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download) stable version (or LTS) and then:

```sh
npm i @qiskit/cloud
```

## Use

:pencil: You can visit more advanced examples in the [test folder](test).

```js
'use strict';

const Cloud = require('@qiskit/cloud');

const cloud = new Cloud();

console.log('Version');
console.log(cloud.version);

cloud
  .login('YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN_HERE')
  .then(() => cloud.backends())
  .then(backs => console.log(backs));
```
